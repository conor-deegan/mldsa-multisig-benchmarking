# NOTES — binius-prover loop log

One line per increment: what changed + current oracle status. Newest at the bottom.

- Pre-M0: added binius64 as a pinned git dep (binius-frontend/circuits/core @
  binius-zk/binius64 rev 8f21b34) in new `binius-prover/Cargo.toml` + empty
  `src/lib.rs` stub; added crate to workspace members; `cargo build -p binius-prover
  --lib` green, dep locked. Filled every SPEC.md blank (§2 mod-q gadgets: single-word
  imul + divmod-hint + icmp_ult range-check, no bignum; §2 NTT over schoolbook with
  count justification; §2 one coeff/word packing + t1/z/c̃/h/w1 decode; §3 SHAKE built
  on keccak_f1600 with 0x1F pad — no SHAKE gadget exists; §3a ExpandA/SampleInBall
  fixed over-sampling; §4 mirror raw_verify_mu = c̃ equality only). Added §0a facts and
  §8 Corrections (no norm/weight checks, no key-distinctness in verify_all). No circuit
  code written. Oracle RED (expected): xcheck does not compile until M0 implements
  build/circuit_accepts/prove_and_verify/Case. Next: M0 scaffold + CLI.
